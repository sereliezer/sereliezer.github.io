      <title>Analyzing GFlowNets: Stability, Expressiveness, and Assessment</title>

      <description>Abstract Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful samplers for distributions over compositional objects (e.g., graphs). In this work, we analyze GFlowNets from three fundamental perspectives: stability, expressiveness, and assessment.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop Causal Discovery under Latent Confounding using Ancestral GFlowNets</title>

      <description>Abstract Structure learning is the crux of causal inference. Notably, causal discovery (CD) algorithms are brittle when data is scarce, possibly inferring imprecise causal relations that contradict expert knowledge &amp;ndash; especially when considering latent confounders.</description>

      <title>Prior Specification for Bayesian Matrix Factorization via Prior Predictive Matching</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/publications/2023b/</link>

      <description>Abstract The behavior of many Bayesian models used in machine learning critically depends on the choice of prior distributions, controlled by some hyperparameters typically selected through Bayesian optimization or cross-validation.</description>

      <title>Time is of the Essence: a Joint Hierarchical RNN and Point Process Model for Time and Item Predictions</title>

      <description>Abstract In recent years session-based recommendation has emerged as an increasingly applicable type of recommendation. As sessions consist of sequences of events, this type of recommendation is a natural fit for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).</description>

      <title>Content-Based Social Recommendation with Poisson Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/publications/2017a/</link>

      <description>Abstract We introduce Poisson Matrix Factorization with Content and Social trust information (PoissonMF-CS), a latent variable probabilistic model for recommender systems with the objective of jointly modeling social trust, item content and userâ€™s preference using Poisson matrix factorization framework.</description>

      <title>Large-scale distributed locality-sensitive hashing for general metric data</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/publications/2014a/</link>

      <description>Abstract Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is extremely competitive for similarity search, but works under the assumption of uniform access cost to the data, and for just a handful of dissimilarities for which locality-sensitive families are available.</description>
