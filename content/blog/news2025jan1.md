I am delighted to announce that our paper, *[When do GFlowNets Learn the Right Distribution?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9GsgCUJtic)*, has been accepted for presentation at **[ICLR 2025](https://iclr.cc)**! This work advances our theoretical understanding of **Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets)** by examining the impact of balance violations on their ability to approximate target distributions and proposing a novel metric for assessing correctness.
**Update** our work has been selected as a *Spotlight* at ICLR 2025 ðŸŽ‰ (5.1% of the submitted papers are selected for a spotlight or an oral)

### **When do GFlowNets Learn the Right Distribution?**  
**Authors:** Tiago Silva, Rodrigo Barreto Alves, Eliezer de Souza da Silva, Amauri H Souza, Vikas Garg, Samuel Kaski, Diego Mesquita  
**Conference:** International Conference on Learning Representations (**ICLR 2025**)  

**Summary:**  
We analyze when and whether GFlowNets successfully approximate the correct target distribution, addressing their **stability under balance violations** and the **limitations of their parameterization with graph neural networks (GNNs)**. Our findings show that imbalance effects are **unevenly distributed across the flow network**, impacting accuracy based on flow intensity. We also highlight fundamental **representation limits of GNN-based GFlowNets** when learning distributions over graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a **new metric for evaluating GFlowNets**, empirically demonstrating its superior effectiveness over existing evaluation protocols.
