Scientific knowledge is built on the foundations of probabilistic thinking, aiming to understand not only the associations between events but also how one event influences the occurrence of another. Uncertainty plays a central role in this endeavor, allowing us to capture inherent variations in the world and describe the variability in the models we use to represent reality. In ML/AI, our goal is to develop algorithms and processes that replicate human efforts in learning from data, inferring new relationships, predicting future outcomes, estimating causal relationships and effects, and making data-driven decisions.

My fundamental interest lies in understanding the principles of statistical learning, model building, and decision-making. Specifically, I focus on the role of uncertainty in enhancing the models and algorithms in machine learning and artificial intelligence. This involves integrating confidence measures into decisions and processes, leading to better engineering and design across various applications. I am passionate about applying ML/AI models to different scientific fields and creating a feedback loop between information, knowledge building, and model inference, mediated by increased insights and confidence in machine-generated knowledge.
